## I am 
Hey there im Lantern Man. I enjoy computers, writing and social justice. I do not like product-like presentations that depict individuals merely as economic units because, above all, I am human, not just a cog in the capital machine.  So, let me introduce myself first as a person, and then as a contributor to the broader system.

My vison is to be able to be as close as possible to the true nature of ourselves and stop living as the "I" that we know, moving beyond the everyday "I" that we are often reminded of by those around usâ€”what they say we are, what they say we like. In reality, the notion of "I" is an illusion; we do not exist in the ways we often think we do. We transcend concepts of life and death, and what we perceive as reality is often just a construct of thoughts and mental formations.

I still think humanity can be saved and believe we can be liberated from the capitalist exploitation system that dominates our world. Working towards a society free of authoritarian constraints is one of my main goals. I aim to free minds and help people realize that they are much more than the roles and identities assigned to them.
