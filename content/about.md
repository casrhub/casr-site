## I am 
Hey there im Lantern Man, I nejoy computers, writing and social justice. I dont like product like presentations to talk about me because I am human then i am a capital productive product so I'll first present myself as a human then as a productive machine that serves the capital. 

My vison is to be able to be as close as possible to the true nature of ourselves and stop living as the "I" that we know, in the daily basis we get remined by the poeple around us what, who we are and what we like, the truth is that there is not an "I" in fact we do not exist as we think it. We are beyond dead and alive and everything we think is reality are just thoughts and menta formations. I have a strong connction with mankind and beliove we can be saveed from the capitalist explotation system that rules the world, working towards a society free of authoritarian constraints is one of my main goals, free the mind and realize they are beyond what people have assigned them as they are. 


 
## I am (capital system product presentation) 

Most of my work i have done is in the web development area. I have worked with the [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) mainly to develop fullstack web applications levereging next js. In other interest I am a fan of blockchain since it alaigns with my give power to society philosophy and have deloped some web3 wallet trackers in [solana](https://solana.com/) blockchain (I strongly believe btc returns the pwer to society, it does not always protect you agianst infinite money pritnig but also provides transparency and decentralization.)
